## Overview

This project is designed to simulate a car rental service, allowing the admin to manage vehicle availability, and customers to search for and book cars. The data is displayed in a tabular format using the `tabulate` library, making it easy to view car information. The project is a simple CLI-based (Command Line Interface) system, built for demonstration purposes.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- **tabulate**: To display data in a tabular format.

You can install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for expanding this project:

- **Database Integration**: Currently, the car data is hardcoded. Adding a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) would allow for persistent storage of cars and bookings.
- **Authentication System**: Implement user authentication for admins and customers.
- **GUI**: Create a graphical user interface (e.g., using Tkinter or a web-based framework) to make the application more user-friendly.
- **Booking History**: Allow customers to view their previous bookings.
- **Payment System**: Integrate a payment gateway to handle transactions for booking a car.
